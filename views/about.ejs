    <h3>General Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      ACM@UIUC is a student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery, a professional society dedicated to advancing human capabilities through information technology. Founded in 1947, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is the largest and
      oldest international scientific and educational computer society in the industry today. Organized only a year after the unveiling of ENIAC, the first general purpose electronic computer, ACM was established by mathematicians and electrical
      engineers to advance the science and application of information technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      ACM@UIUC is a group of dedicated people who are interested in exploring the possibilities of computers and learning more about how to use and develop them. ACM is divided into Special Interest Groups, or SIGs, which focus on specific interest areas in
      computer science and computing. Each SIG holds its own meetings. Each SIG is responsible for organizing its own activities and determining its own purpose. Several SIGs are project based, with the majority of their activities dedicated to
      computing projects in their area of interest, often presented at Engineering Open House. Some SIGs run workshops and tech talks to discuss topics related to their interest group. To find out more about our SIGs, visit the SIG page and attend
      a meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      ACM also hosts several general events, which are listed on our calendar page. These events include social activities (such as picnics, swim nights, activity weeks, game nights), outreach activities (such as ACM Open House, Student Lecture Series, and
      educational activities for high school and middle school students), and the annual Reflections | Projections conference. All ACM activities and SIG meetings are open to the entire University community, regardless of computer experience and
      background.
    </p>
    <p>
      ACM@UIUC holds an Executive meetings most Mondays, at which the direction of ACM is defined. Everyone is welcome to attend and make suggestions for new ACM groups or events. Decisions about such events and other important ACM matters are also made at
      these meetings.
    </p>
    <p>ACM@UIUC is a registered 501(c)(3) non-for-profit organization.</p>

    <h3>Facilites</h3>
    <h4>1104 Siebel - The ACM Office</h4>
    <p>
      The ACM@UIUC office is located in room 1104 of the Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science (SC) along the main hallway. ACM's office space includes 3 rooms and limited access to the student projects and embedded real-time systems labs, all thanks
      to the Computer Science Department.<br/>The ACM Office is open from 9 AM to 5 PM most schooldays, and is manned by members of the Exec Board. Although our official hours are 9 to 5, members (especially the sysadmins) have been known to haunt the office until the wee hours of
      the morning. Stop in and join the ACM Up All Night Crew.
    </p>
    <h4>1106 Siebel - ACM Computer Lab</h4>
    <p>While there are computers in both 1104 and 1110, 1106 is home to the majority of the ACM Cluster. 1106 is frequently used for SIG dev sessions and tutorials. 1106 is also home to Caffeine, ACM's own networked soda machine [thanks to GLUG and SIGEmbedded]</p>
    <h4>1110 Siebel - ACM Electronics and Robotics Lab</h4>
    <p>
      1110 is ACM's electronics and robotics lab. It is home to many hardware-intensive SIGs which need extra space and gear to work on their projects. Among the groups that use 1110 frequently are SIGBot and SIGEmbedded. Access to 1110 is generally restricted
      due to the nature of the lab, and permitted where project work requires use of the lab.
