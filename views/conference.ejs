    Nineteen years ago, the student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery at the University of Illinois (ACM@UIUC) held its first computing conference. 150 students from across the midwest attended the event, which was supported by 14 corporations.
    Since its beginning, the conference has grown to include the MechMania programming contest and a job fair. This year, we're proud to welcome you to the 20th annual conference from October 2-5, 2014, at the Urbana-Champaign campus. We expect to have over 700 student attendees and more than 25 corporate sponsors.
    ACM could not host Reflections | Projections without the generous support of our sponsors. Their donations fund all the events and help keep student fees low.
